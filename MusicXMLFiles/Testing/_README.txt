NONE of the files in here are valid MusicXML files.
They are simply used for testing the parser/exporter functionalities.
The “partwise test.xml” and “timewise test.xml” files contain every
element in the MusicXML schema (XSD).
Where as the “not MusicXML.xml” file is an XML file but not a MusicXML
file, so there is no way that it can be parsed successfully.
